            <strong>Governing Law and Dispute Resolution:</strong> These Terms
            of Service and any disputes arising out of or relating to the use of
            VA Claims Academy, LLC's services shall be governed by and construed
            in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to
            its conflict of law provisions. Users agree that any legal action or
            proceeding arising out of or relating to these terms or the use of
            our services shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal
            courts located in Travis County, Texas. By using our services, users
            consent to the personal jurisdiction of these courts and waive any
            objections to venue or inconvenient forum. In the event of a
            dispute, the parties agree to first engage in good faith
            negotiations to resolve the dispute informally. If the dispute
            cannot be resolved through informal negotiations, the parties agree

            mediator. If mediation is unsuccessful, the parties may pursue
            formal legal action, subject to the terms of this agreement. The

            reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. Users agree to waive their
            right to a trial by jury and to participate in any class action
            lawsuits against VA Claims Academy, LLC. Any cause of action or
            claim must be commenced within one year after the cause of action
            accrues, or such cause of action or claim is permanently barred.
            This limitation of time shall apply to the fullest extent permitted
            by law.

            <strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision of these Terms of
            Service is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, in whole
            or in part, by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision
            shall be modified or severed to the minimum extent necessary to make
            it valid, legal, and enforceable. If such modification or severance
            is not possible, the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision
            shall be severed from these terms, and the remaining provisions
            shall remain in full force and effect. The invalidity, illegality,
            or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity,
            legality, or enforceability of any other provision of these terms.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            In the event that a provision is severed or modified pursuant to
            this section, the parties agree to engage in good faith negotiations
            to replace the severed or modified provision with a valid, legal,
            and enforceable provision that achieves, to the greatest extent
            possible, the economic, business, and other purposes of the severed
            or modified provision. If the parties are unable to agree upon a
            replacement provision, the remaining provisions of these terms shall
            continue in effect as if the severed or modified provision had not
            been included.
